# ampersand

Ampersand is a web application that lets teachers assign writing and receive responses through Google Drive without
the pain. It's written in Kotlin with the Spring Boot web framework, and uses very fancy Thymeleaf templating. Just
build and run with Gradle or your favorite IDE to try it out!
